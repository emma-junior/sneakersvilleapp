## My process

### Built with
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Typescript
- SCSS
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Mongo db

### What I learned

On the frontend aspect- It deepened my knowledge on typescript, redux and i got to fully understood the benefits of using SCSS over the normal CSS.
On the backend aspect- I learnt and understood how to make CRUD api's using the express.js framwork and the Mongo db database. I also understood more on JWT and how to use it in a project.
I am proud of the application I built and the logic applied.

### Continued development

Continuous development would be around testing using cypress.
